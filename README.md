## Technologies Used in This Artifact

This artifact uses a tech stack consisting of React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, which is hosted on the AWS Cloud. This artifact can run on almost all web browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc).

## Rationale for Artifact Selection

The team chose this artifact because of its importance to the overall project as well as the requirements this artifact poses for the tech stack chosen. The main purpose of this assignment was to test the team's preferred tech stack. This artifact requires the tech stack to be able to process and store files, which is the main constraint of the entire application at large. In addition, this artifact will give the team a rough overview of what the end product may look like. All in all, the dashboard and upload interface was the best artifact to choose because it thoroughly tests the tech stack in relation to the requirements for this application, and it also gives the team a rough idea of what the application may end up looking like.
